# Tutorial for 2021 GO-BGC Science Workshop (Python version)

**To get started:**

1. Navigate to the file [`GO_BGC_Workshop_Python_tutorial.ipynb`](https://github.com/go-bgc/workshop-python/blob/main/GO_BGC_Workshop_Python_tutorial.ipynb) in this repository.
2. Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file.
3. If needed, sign into your Google account. A standard, free, personal Google account is recommended, as not all institutional Google accounts allow Colab access to Google Drive.
4. In Google Colab, near the top menu bar, click on the button that says "Copy to Drive."
5. Switch to the browser tab with the newly created "Copy of GO-BGC Workshop - Python tutorial.ipynb" file. This version is editable and is saved in your Google Drive in a folder called "Colab Notebooks." You are ready to go!

**Notes:**

If you would just like to view the tutorial notebook, a partially-interactive rendered view is available here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/go-bgc/workshop-python/blob/main/GO_BGC_Workshop_Python_tutorial.ipynb.

If for some reason you do not have access to a Google account, you can download the .ipynb file linked above and run it from a local Jupyter installation. When running this notebook locally, the first code block that authenticates with Google Drive should be deleted and file paths in the following code block should be changed to match your local file structure.
